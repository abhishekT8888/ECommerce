#E-Commerce App This is an E-commerce application built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a platform for users to browse and purchase products online. The application includes various features such as routing, authentication, and a shopping cart.

#Features Routing: The application utilizes React Router for client-side routing. It allows users to navigate between different pages and access specific product categories or individual product details.

Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out of the application. This provides personalized experiences and allows users to access their order history, manage their profile, and perform actions such as adding items to their wishlist.

Product Listings: The app displays a list of products available for purchase. Users can browse through different categories, filter products based on various criteria, and view detailed information about each product.
